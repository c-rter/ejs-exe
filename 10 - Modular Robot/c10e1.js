buildGraph could be created as a module, which would receive roads format (or more) and return the unique data structure in roadGraph.

Randomized VillageState objects could be returned from a module.

RandomPick likely already exists as an npm module.

There are likely many pathfinding npm packages that could replace or augment findRoute and goalOrientedRobot.
